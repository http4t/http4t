## Todo

- add an example of a streaming body (maybe large binary files?)
- JWT- asymmetric keys, plus client-side validation against public key
- server-side templating/rendering example
- tracing (zipkin?)
- static file server (dot segments first)
- front end, including how easy it is to inject the api, and test using enzyme
